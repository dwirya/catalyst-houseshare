This is the repository for our social project, where we aim to tackle the housing problem in Mornington Peninsula.
As there were many elderly living alone in a spacious house with unused rooms and young people who cannot afford to pay rent in the area, we decide to connect the two parties together.
Elderly people are able to rent the rooms to these young people, and can offer reduced rent (concessions) if the young people help them out in running their errands, such as cooking and cleaning the house.
Our MVP is a mere front-end with static data, which shows people how the concessions will work. It is just like a website for youngsters finding a house to rent, but there will be options for these young people which chores they are willing to do for the elderly.
